For the spatial variability of the bandpass: 

Temperature variation across the focal plane affects the quantum efficiency in the y band. 

qeTemperature :  
QE_T_panstarrs.dat
 This QE as a function of temperature curve comes from PS measurements, at a range of wavelengths.
 I translated the PS data to relative QE changes as a function of Temperature
  and wavelength, then wrote that out in this file. 


temperatureMap - Temperature variability across the focal plane: 
Txy_*.dat 
 These files come from a spreadsheet from Pat Haskell on Camera Team (this is V1).
 The 'flat' versions represent an ideal case where the chips are flat 
 and stick well to the temperature control doohickeys. 
 Could be used with additional random T offset (per CCD) between 0 to +13. 
 The 'tilt' versions represent a more realistic (?) case where the chips
 are not all firmly adhered to the temperature control units, so there
 starts to be a tilt in temperature across each CCD and raft. 
 These can be used with either an additional random offset of 0-3 deg, 
  or with a random offset between 0 to +13 deg.  (uniform distribution). 
 The raft represented by the 11-33 CCD's can be duplicated across the 
  focal plane.(how much T variation between rafts?? prob. similar to btwn CCD)

vignette: 
Vignette.dat
 comes from rewriting the data in the vignette function (which was itself based on
 Vignette_3.3.TXT, which is presumably an engineering doc although I couldn't find it
 in docushare.)
vignette.py is a python program to write out the Vignette.dat file (should not need to be reused).
